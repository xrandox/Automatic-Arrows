# Automatic-Arrows
Sick of markers with no trail? Tired of missing one that you were right next to just because you didn't see it? Well, look no further!

Automatic Arrows is a small Pathing script that will automatically generate arrows pointing to the closest markers around you. All you have to do is toggle off any unwanted categories and toggle on automatic arrows, and they'll do the rest!

# How-To
